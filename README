NOTE:
  Please take note of the programme licence (the COPYING file), as well as the
  credits (the CREDITS file).


###- DETAILS -##################################################################

Compilation:
  Make sure you have libcurie-11 installed, then:

    $ icemake

  A number of compilation options are available if you run into issues. To see
  them, use:

    $ icemake --help

Installation:
  use this command to install regularly (for example into /, in the example):

    $ icemake -dif /

  NOTE that this will include some header files which you may not want to keep,
  as well as shared and static libraries which may not be necessary. Also you
  may wish to move the docs from /share to /usr/share. Or install everything in
  /usr instead of /.

  If you're on gentoo, the ebuilds on the jyujin overlay will do this for you,
  so just use those instead of installing things manually.

  Best bet is IRC: freenode #kyuba
